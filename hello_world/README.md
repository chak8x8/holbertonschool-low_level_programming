C Programming Project

Description
This project is part of the Holberton School's low-level programming curriculum. It focuses on understanding and applying fundamental concepts in C programming through a series of tasks that involve writing scripts, compiling C code, and working with preprocessor, assembly, and executable files.

Tasks Completed

1. Run a C file through the preprocessor
   - Script: Created a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result in a file named `c`.
  
2. Compile a C file without linking
   - Script: Wrote a script that compiles a C file without linking. The output is an object file with a `.o` extension.

3. Generate assembly code from a C file
   - Script: Wrote a script that generates the assembly code for a C file. The output is saved as a file with a `.s` extension.

4. Compile a C file and create an executable named `cisfun`
   - Script: Compiled a C file and created an executable named `cisfun`.

5. Print a message using `puts`
   - C Program: Wrote a C program that prints the message:
     "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"
     using the `puts` function.

6. Print a message using `printf`
   - C Program: Wrote a C program that prints the message:
     "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,"
     using the `printf` function.

7. Print the size of various data types
   - C Program: Wrote a C program that prints the size of various data types (char, int, long int, long long int, float) on the system it is compiled and run on.
