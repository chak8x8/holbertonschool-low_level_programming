# C Programming Project

## Overview
This project consists of several tasks aimed at improving understanding and proficiency in C programming, particularly in handling basic syntax, loops, and functions.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Positive or Negative**  
   Wrote a program that determines if a randomly assigned number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **Last Digit**  
   Created a program to print the last digit of a randomly assigned number and its characteristics.

3. **Print Alphabet**  
   Developed a program that prints the lowercase alphabet using only `putchar`.

4. **Print Alphabet in Uppercase**  
   Implemented a program that prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabets.

5. **Print Alphabet Except Q and E**  
   Wrote a program that prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

6. **Print Single Digit Numbers**  
   Created a program to print all single-digit numbers of base 10.

7. **Print Lowercase Alphabet in Reverse**  
   Developed a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

8. **Print Base 16**  
   Wrote a program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

9. **Print Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers**  
   Created a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by a comma and a space.

## Compilation
To compile the programs, use the following command:
```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_executable>
